# About the Author

Specialized in custom software development and creating workflow tools for content creators. I am passionate to learn new stuff every day as much as searching for optimal time-killer solutions. My personal goal is to optimize workflows and make life easier.

Also I love to collect, dig around rare/leaked,games/software or game console/embedded development kits.
